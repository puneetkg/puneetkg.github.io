# The Pareto Principle

The Pareto principle states that you get 80% of results by applying 20% of efforts and the rest 20% by 80% of efforts.

This is generally true for almost all the situations. I recently applied this principle the hurdle i was facing.

I Identified what are the most important themes required to understand the new area i started working on. Stacked them in descending order of importance. Importance was a heuristic measure that i calculated based on the amount of times any particular theme was talked about in meetings, discussions and meetups.

Once i had this list i picked the top 20% of this list and dug deep to understand the core principles, basic building blocks for these themes. Once i had them under my belt i was able to counter

Have you every applied the Pareto principle?
