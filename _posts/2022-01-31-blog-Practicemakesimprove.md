# Practice makes ~~Perfect~~ Improvement!

It is extremely important to strategise and plan your moves. But once all the strategies are complete and made sense of it becomes extremely important to execute them as well. Execution or practice is required to complete the task or hone your craft.

Even if you have all the strategy and you can't execute the strategy is of no use.

In today's day and age there is nothing "Perfect" anymore. <br />
'*Practice makes perfect*' is outdated. <br />
**'Practice makes Improvement'** is the new motto.<br />
There is always something you can improve upon.

What area did you improve last year?
