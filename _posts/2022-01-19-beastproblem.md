What really happens when you pick up projects which are as huge as an elephant

We bite off more than we can chew and we get choked up.

We get lost, overwhelmed, frustrated and impatient. We want instant results, but we haven’t counted the investment or cost, and thus we lack the commitment necessary to finish.

We’re unclear of the goal, or don’t know what results we’re working toward.

We run out of energy and time or mismanage both.

We get sidetracked and distracted, bogged down and lost in the details.

We give up too soon or hang on too long.

At the end, We fail. We don’t finish. The project flops. And everybody is disappointed.

Sound familiar?

Whether you’re tackling a project solo, or working on a team … doing something for yourself, or delivering it for someone else … you’re likely to be tackling the eating of an elephant.<br />
So, to eat an elephant what you should do is

— Set SMART Goals: Setting a smart goal is the first step towards achieving your massive goal. Often, SMART goal is described as (S)pecific, (M)easurable, (A)chievable, (R)elevant and (T)ime bound

**Specific**: Create a list of extremely specific small tasks that on completion with give you the end result
**Measurable**: Identify metrics to evaluate the progress/improvements
**Achievable**: All the tasks must be within your scope of work i.e. possible to be accomplished
**Relevant**: Is relevant to the larger vision, improves the business(if a personal project, you!) in some form
**Time**: State the deadline for each of the task, a Specific timeframe

Remember
### “The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.”
