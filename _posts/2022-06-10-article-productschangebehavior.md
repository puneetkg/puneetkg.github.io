# The Birthday Overseas

Birthdays are bitter sweet. On one hand you understand that you are getting old and on another hand you understand that you are getting wiser, you are learning new things, you are expanding your horizons.

Who knows what one should feel on their birthdays, as long as you are surrounded by people who love you, nothing else actually matters. The more i grow the more i tend to agree that the happiness to earning curve is true.

- Means you need ~$80K per annum in 2015 in order to lead a happy life. But this data is 7 years old. In 2022, how much will that number be?
- Inflation over 7 years was ~22% and taking that into account, the amount becomes ~$98K. i.e. ~80 Lacs post tax, i.e. ~1.2Cr pre Tax per annum.
- The final adjustment is to take into account the purchasing power and expense of living . $100K is 35Lacs pre tax i.e. ~50Lac per annum in India

So, in order to lead the happiest life you need to hit the 50 Lac per annum mark and lead a happy life.

Anyway, we ended up having dinner in "Go Thai" near Sharjah, a friendly advise do not ever order soupy noodles if you are not that much hungry. The Bowl is huge.

How did you spend your birthday?
