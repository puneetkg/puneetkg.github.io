# how to overcome a new hurdle

I recently moved teams and have been feeling a little overwhelmed by the kind of work, the kind of pace and the kind insights the team requires. It seemed like everyone already knew and is operating at a different level which is considered as the baseline. Meaning i am operating below baseline.

This impacted me psychologically pushing me to exhibit imposter syndrome. I wanted to find a way to structurally solve my problem and realised that i was constantly searching for a framework that can be applied to this situation. Unfortunately, i haven't found a framework yet but what helped me was a post on reddit. Over the course of my career, i have solved these situations by allocating more time to these challenges.

>Brute Force method:
Spearhead into all the tasks and give as much time as you require to close,

>>Pro:
- Steep learning Curve
- High chance

>>Cons:
- Unstructured learnings
- Time consuming
- Taxing on other areas of your life.

Not an optimal solution

As you grow you realise the most valuable thing you have is time, you need to deploy time extremely carefully, If effective time management is mastered, you can master anything in life. When it comes to your time, the early you understand that you need to behave like 'Gollum' from Lord of the rings the better you are in the long term.

Apply the pareto principle, and identify the top 20%

Practice is the way to beat that anxiety, mastery is the way to feel confident. It the time you don't have mastery you will always be looking for folks
What frameworks have you used to overcome the unsurmountable area.
