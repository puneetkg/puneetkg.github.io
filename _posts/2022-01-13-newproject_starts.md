Happy to announce that finally started my side project... Was waiting for this to culminate for some time. I'll start sharing my progress here so that you can see how you too can begin from scratch in data science and build end to end solutions.

The project delves into 'Computer Vision' and its applications

Since i am currently a Noob, i'll be working fro scratch to build the framework. Revisiting my neural network knowledge.

This is the first set of articles you can expect to read in the near future:
* Basics of Neural Networks
* Hyper parameter tuning of neural Networks
* Working with images, understanding how to deal with pixels
* Object detection
* image segmentation
* instance segmentation


Do you have any questions around computer vision? Shoot them at me!
