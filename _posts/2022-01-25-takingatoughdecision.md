# How to take a tough

I have always been intrigued by what it takes to make a decision?

There are multiple frameworks that allow you to take a decision. However, most of them fail when we need to take an important life altering decision.
I came across a framework mentioned by [Ankur Warikoo](https://ankurwarikoo.com/ "Ankur warikoo"). This framework is specific to take tough decisions.

This framework helps narrow down the gap between the options that we think we want and the options that what we think we should be taking.

**The worst possible outcome approach** <br />
The core to taking any decision as per Ankur is the resolution between these two vectors. the more aligned they are on any aspect the easier it is to take a decision.


Ask by taking that decision what is the worst thing that can happen?

think of the worst case scenario

Imagine that happening as vividly as possible, think of all the aspects

* If you are okay with that scenario, TAKE THAT DECISION <br />
* If you have even a single spec of doubt with that scenario, DO NOT TAKE THAT DECISION

If you actually want to do what you want, train your mind to become absolutely comfortable with the worst case scenario. The moment you become comfortable with this worst case is when taking that decision becomes easy.

What do you do when you have to take a tough decision?
