# How to take a tough

I have always been intrigued by what it takes to make a decision?

There are multiple frameworks that allow you to take a decision. However, most of them fail when we need to take an important life altering decision.
I came across a framework mentioned by [Ankur Warikoo](https://ankurwarikoo.com/ "Ankur warikoo"). This framework is specific to take tough decisions.


How to narrow down the gap between what options we think we have with what we think we want to take?

**The worst possible outcome approach**


Ask yourself, by taking that decision what is the worst thing that can happen?

think of the worst case scenario

If you are okay with that scenario, TAKE THAT DECISION
If you have even a single spec of doubt with that scenario, DO NOT TAKE THAT DECISION


What do you do when you have to take a tough decision?
