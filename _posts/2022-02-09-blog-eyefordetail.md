# The eye of Sauron

It is important to have an eye for detail. This is what differentiates from everyone else

In order to improve attention to detail you can:

1. Give your mind time to recuperate, sleep time is the most important time for the body

2. Take a break every 5 minutes - Research has shown that breaks replenishes the mind and brain quickly. During the breaks best thing is to take a walk, that helps you detach from the problem and activates your sub conscious to think of the solution. So, during a break take a walk, stretch and becomes aware of your surroundings.

3. Take the time to understand how your work impacts the life around you.

4. Ask for advices from others on what they think can be an area of improvement.


Do you have an eye for detail?
