First Day at office and you are told that you are the underdog who has to survive with the big fish. Amongst the "Big Kahunas". Folks with so much power and pull, gravity feels lighter. It feels good to know that you have joined a new company and they are excited to have you there have given you all the autonomy that you want and need, but it is something else to know that you need to survive otherwise the big fishes are coming to eat you up and make you do what they want.

Well highlight of the day was realising that if you only follow traffic rules like crossing roads only at the zebra crossing adds at least 25% more distance, no wonder people in Dubai are fit, they walk so much and so often.

Note to self, being in a new country start understanding how distance works in walking terms not in terms of a bike or car.

Got a lot of stuff from the company today, the hype lasted 10 mins like the way material things do.

My Round 4 (Internal counts of the pivots points that changed my life) starts today. The feeling is in my bones that it is going to be a goof stint.


Have you ever felt something in your bones that has turned out to be correct?
