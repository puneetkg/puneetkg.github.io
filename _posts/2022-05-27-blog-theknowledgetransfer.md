Spent a lot of time understanding things that makes the business tick. a lot of scope for improvement and a lot of scope to bring in great projects. Let's see how fast i can scale up. I need to scale up on the things fast and understand the business, data sources and similar stuff faster to make the actual impact sooner.


Learning: No one in corporate life cares how you get the stuff done. It is your duty to make people understand how complicated the stuff is and how you are the only person that can figure out the simplest path through the problem in order grow and excel. Ever heard of "Undercommit and Overdeliver". That is the truth of corporate life.
