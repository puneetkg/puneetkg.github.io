# If you Don't ask the Answer is Always NO!!

The one principle that i have constantly applied and have seen it work. It is one of the principles i live by. It is important to ask questions. It is important to understand

- I asked random strangers to help me out in another city and 5 out 10 people actually helped me out
- I organised a chess tournament at Flipkart and asked my SVP, VP, SDs individually to attend the tournament, I was amazed to see everyone said yes and 9 out of 10 actually attended the event.

Remember:
>If you do not ask, the answer is always no.

Have you ever used this principle and seen the results ?
