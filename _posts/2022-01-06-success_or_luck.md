Have you ever thought that any success that your competition gets is only due to luck. While any success you get is a culmination of your Hard Work. I certainly used to think that while growing up. I would not understand how they were so good without they being lucky. Which made me look at luck as this magic spell that only a few special ones get, while other mortals merely roam in their shadows. I took to buying lucky charms, anything and everything that would bring luck to me from the little pocket money i got.

Oh god how wrong i was!

One incident changed everything. I worked hard and i was selected but i didnt attribute this to luck. and hence i understood how others are getting lucky

Very Recently, I stumbled upon a video by [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA) *(a sidenote: tremendous channel i have been watching a lot of its videos, you should check them out)*  named "Is Success Luck or Hard Work?", This video does a great simulation of what is more important to be selected as an Astronaut.

He generates 2 scores:
1. Skill Score: For skill, Hard work and Talent out of 100
2. Luck Score: for how lucky they are out of 100

To get the overall score for each individual, based on which they will be selected in the program, he added them into a 95:5 ratio.

This Simulation was run over 1000 times and the users and the results that came out were the selected were all very lucky. The tricky part is if we remove the luck factor, out of 11 people only ~1.6 people would get in the program. With only 5% of Luck, 9-10 people get selected instead of people who had high talent, What this means is

>When competition is fierce, talent and skill do not matter, you also need to catch a break.

But, it is a useful delusion to believe that we all are in control of our destiny, since if we don't we are less likely to invest more time in any activityto become better at it.

So What to do if you want to becomes successful in this kind of a world?
The answer is paradoxical

First: you should believe that your success comes only because of your talent and hard work

Second: Understand that that is not the complete truth. If you end up being successful, you should know that luck played some role for your success.


What were the incidents where you felt extraordinarily lucky?
