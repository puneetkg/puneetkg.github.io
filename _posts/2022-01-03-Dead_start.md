Once you internalise this, no exercise in a day will not have any huge impact on the results at the end of the year. Hence, don't beat yourself up over the split milk. People usually overestimate what they can do in a week and grossly underestimate what they can achieve in a year.

Mindset shift is a gradual process. It is a game of consistency. You need to give yourself time to make the change and not judge yourself for any small hiccup/s. Do not obsess over small losses, instead focus on how you can not make them the next day.
