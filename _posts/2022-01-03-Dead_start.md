It was a bad day today, spent majority of my time binging on youtube. I was feeling horrible after wasting the complete day when i came along a James Clear post that mentioned, "every decision you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become". This sank my heart as I had taken the worst action of binging on random cat videos the whole day (well not actually cat videos but you get the drift)

While going to bed i thought about it a little more and then realised the true meaning of the post. The keyword is 'Actions', plural. a Single action doesn't define who you are.  What it means is that you will become the weighted average of the kind of decisions you taken in your life. in life the kind of results/mindset you see is a lag metric created by the kind of decisions you have taken historically.

Now if you look closely, that 1 day slip doesn't really impact the long term results. Once you internalise this you start to look at things from a 16K ft view and not what i can achieve tomorrow. Hence, don't beat yourself up over the split milk. It is okay to miss that 1 day of workout or that 1 cheat meal or that 1 extra piece of cake as long as you get back on the wagon, you will be fine in the long run. People usually overestimate what they can do in a week and grossly underestimate what they can achieve in a year.

Mindset shift is a gradual process. It is a game of consistency. You need to give yourself time to make the change and not judge yourself for any small hiccup/s. Do not obsess over small losses, instead focus on how to small wins next day and then the next day and then the day after that. Focus on showing up everyday
