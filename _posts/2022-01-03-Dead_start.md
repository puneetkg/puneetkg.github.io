It is a bad day today, spent majority of my time binging on youtube. A James Clear post mentioned, every decision you take is a vote to what kind of a person you become in the long term.

Does that mean if i somehow fall off the wagon i.e. ow do you break the chain of bad habits that consume your day and valuable time.

Shift in your mindset is a gradual process. You need to give yourself time to make the change and not judge yourself and a small hiccup, because a small hiccup one day doesn't mean that you will not be able to achieve in the long run. Focus on showing up everyday, if for some reason, any reason, couldnt wak up early, boss shouted on you, had a fight with a friend, or even as simple as today didn't feel like it, Acknowledge it and move on, show up the next day and  

What has been your kryptonite you are dealing with?
