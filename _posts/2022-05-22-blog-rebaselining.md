#Re-baseline

Day1 in Dubai:

It becomes easy to ease into a new city if you have relatives or friends already present in it. You get to know the city through their eyes and establish a an expectation baseline of the new city.

I visited 'La Mer' in Dubai. I learnt french in school and some voice in the back of my head told me that mer meant 'Mother' but that was m√©re. I got to know the historic view of 'La Mer', it was a long stretch of beaches where people could come visit and have a great time.

Dubai Business in the 60s was handled by Chotrani, a guy from Indore. He transformed the shopping system in Dubai. but as he grew older his family couldn't keep up with the times and came crashing down.
