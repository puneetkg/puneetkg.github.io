# The Semantic Trees Framework

With the every changing world that is constantly moving faster, learning something new has become a skill in today that is a necessity to stay relevant. In order to succeed you need to be able to learn anything. Serial Entrepreneurs and business men have shown this first hand. People who have created multiple successful businesses have shown that anything can be learnt and iterated over. The education system in india is still way way way far off from learning. Students today cram the answers rather than understand its applications

I was recently struggling in scaling up in my new team as i could figure out where to start. This led me find some framework that allows to learn any subject as soon as possible.

I found this framework used by Elon Musk, that can help learn any new area as quickly as possible.

Elon Musk:
>“One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”

According to Musk, you must start with the fundamentals first like a trunk of the tree, ensure that you have the best possible grasp of the fundamentals then start building the branches of the trees and then finally reach the leaves. If started the other way, there is a lot of unidentified dump of information that is difficult to track and make sense of.

How do you scale up in any new field or area?
