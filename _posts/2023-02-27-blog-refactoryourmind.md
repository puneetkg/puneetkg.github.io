# The Trap of Expectations you put yourself in

### Accepting the situation i am in

Things for the past 6 months have not been easy, a lot of Frustration and uneasiness around what i am doing with my life and where it is going. practicing problem solving for more than 10 years now, brain by default goes into solution mode and tries to justify and solve what it feels is the problem. But, what meets the eye is often not the truth. You need to dig deeper to understand the truth. You will have to analyse your thinking, your mood and your actions and your surroundings to get to the root cause of the problem.

It took me 6 months just to accept the fact that where i am is not where i have been before and the way things work are different. It took me 6 months to leave the past behind and understand that the past that i have been holding to is not the current scenario anymore. It took me 6 months to get out of the delusion and accept the current reality with whatever it is. It took me 6 months to understand that who i think i am in my mind is not who people perceive me to be. It took me 6 months to understand that if you do not show your worth you will not be considered accordingly.

While I can in no way compare myself to Sir Lewis Hamilton, the 7 time World Champion in F1-racing. I believe him and I are in similar situations or so i foolishly draw analogies from in order make myself at ease with the situation that everyone faces these situations, it it not only me.

### Figuring out the best way to solve it

Listening to one of the interviews of Ananth Narayan from Mensa brands changed the whole game from being a victim of my surroundings to holding myself accountable for what is happening and taking action to make changes. This one word changed the whole mindset. "Learnability"

At Mckinsey, one of the most important points that they judge folks on is **how quickly can you get accustomed to the current situation at hand and re-align yourself to solve the problem at hand**.

This completely changed my perspective towards what I was doing, what i need to do in order to excel and make the best of any situation at hand. How the turn tables :D
