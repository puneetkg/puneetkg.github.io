# How to take any decision and not regret it later?

Regret is the feeling of sadness which takes place due to any action taken or failure to take any action.
Eg: I shouldn't have eaten that complete pizza alone
Eg: I should have invested my money when i was in my 20s

Over the years, what has been realised is that everyone has some or other regrets. in order to minimise regret you can ask yourself a question that Jeff Bezos asked himself and established AMAZON.

Jeff Bezos's Regret minimisation framework

> I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldnâ€™t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried.

But, this framework has its flaws, if you apply this to every decision, almost all the decisions will seem like a regret. So, how to use this framework?<br />
Use this framework to only take life changing decisions.

## How to deal with regret?

Remember
>Regret is the combination of a lesson waiting to be learned so you can improve, plus some "bad" feelings. Separate it & ignore the feelings.

The energy of regret is a terrible thing to waste. you separate out the feeling feeling part of it, reflect on your actions take the learning and build a mental model to rescue you from this the next time you are stuck in this situation.

What do you do when you have regrets on the decisions you have taken.
