'3 Idiots' had this famous dialogue that Indians related so much
>""Dost fail ho jaye toh dukh hota hai, lekin dost first aa jaye toh zyada dukh hota hai..." "

I have been happy with the progress that i have seen over the time. This one day i met a school friend after a very long time. We started discussing life, work and we both were trying to nudge towards the one question that everyone wants to know when they meet a friend.
"Are you happy?" - No
"Are you doing fine in life?" - No
"How have you been over these years?" - No

It is:
"Kitna kama raha hai aajkal?"

Well, he was making a lot more than me. Late that day, this sense of "what the hell am i doing with my life" creeped in. It took a lot of time for me to calibrate my mind on why am i comparing? that too only on a single metric?

From childhood we are conditioned to compare ourselves to our friends. Parents compare your scores with your friends

The Whole `Sharmaji ka beta` scenario is so engrained in us since childhood our default is to compare ourselves with whoever is in front of us.

Let's not delve deeper into this else i will not be able to post this, since this post will never end. Okay so we all know we shouldn't compare. To not do that.. try these suggestions out.


1. Understand, where did they start?
2. Turn comparison into inspiration.
3. Stop “shoulding” yourself. - “I should have this by now” or “I should have come further.” But statements like that just keep us focused on what we’re lacking.
4. Have a better discussion with yourself - Instead of telling yourself you’re not competent enough to do the work you want to do, tell yourself you’re brave enough to try something new. Instead of blaming yourself for mistakes in the past, remind yourself that you did the best you could and that you’ve learned from it.


what is your worst comparison story?
