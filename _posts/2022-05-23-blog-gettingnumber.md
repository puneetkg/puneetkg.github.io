When you move into a new country, and the primary indicators which are required for you to identify yourself or tell any governing body that you are a person of this country expire. That is no one cares if you have a PAN card or not, Whether you got your aadhar card or not.

So, since all my identifiers are null and void, today i got a new phone number. Outside India it feels so weird to go 2 kms to a mall to the only shop that sells SIMs, again in India all i would have done is get out of my house walk across the street and buy a new SIM ðŸ˜…


How do you get access to a new SIM in your country?
