Remember the feeling you got when you got to know that tomorrow is a test that you forgot the whole week about, or project/assignment that you never knew existed because you were absent 1 day in school and later no one told you about?

15 years after the you have gone over this traumatic experience, comes a day where you are told that a new company you have switched to, in a new country, has a formal dress code the day before joining in the evening 🤦🏻‍. You frantically run around in a mall at 11.30 to figure out something that you can wear the next morning. Brings back memories.

A few teething issues that come up when you switch companies and enter into a new environment. Someone has famously said:

> If you are feeling discomfort, Congratulations! You are on a path of growth

Have you faced changes while moving into a new organisation?
