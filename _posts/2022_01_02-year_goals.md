For entirety of Lockdown and WFH, a lot of people did a lot of amazing stuff, learnt new things, created new things while i have no track of how i spent my time as the lines between work and home blurred. I was either working all day or spending free time all day, the more i thought about this the more i realised that this is how i was while in vacation mode. Living leisurely, spending time consuming content pushing everything till the moment.

As I start 2021, I have made up my mind to work upon myself irrespective of the place i am at to create a growth mindset. I have identified certain areas which i feel i need to improve upon in order to become a better version of myself.

> Wealth: Money management, investing my money and doing side projects to improve the earning sources
> Health (Mind, Body and Soul) - Start meditation, restart consistent exercise and hit 75kgs with a good muscle mass, do 10 or more things that helps the humankind in some form or another  
> Family - Spend more time with Family and friends
> Knowledge - reading books and taking courses to constantly improve myself
> Friendships - Spend more time with close friends and meet new people, ~50 new people in 2022

What do you think, am i taking too much on?
